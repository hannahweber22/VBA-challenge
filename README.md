# VBA-challenge

#The VBA challenge is to analyze pregenerated stock market data for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. I created a VBA script named VBA_challenge located in the repository which would loop through each stock year's data and output the yearly change, percent change, total stock volume for each ticker. The script would also output the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume out of the tickers. The yearly change is formatted to show negative outcomes in red and positive outcomes in green using conditional formatting. The percentage change is formatted to show outcomes in a percentage format. The excel data is broken up in sheets per year, so the VBA script is written to loop through each sheet in the workbook. Additionally, previews of the results are captured as screenshots in the respository.
